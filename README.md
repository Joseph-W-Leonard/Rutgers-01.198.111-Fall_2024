/*
Syllabus – Fall 2024
Welcome to Introduction to Computer Science, CS111. In this course you will be introduced to fundamental concepts in programming. After completing the course the student will be able to:

Design algorithmic solutions to problems.
Develop, implement, test, and document program code.
Analyze program code for correctness, efficiency, equivalency, and errors.
Demonstrate an understanding of object-oriented methodology in program development.
Select appropriate data types/structures for use in a given application.
Design and modify data structures capable of insertion, deletion, search, copy, and other related tasks.
Demonstrate an understanding of searching and sorting algorithms.
We use pseudocode and the Java programming language for all assignments and exams in the course, but many Java features, such as applets, GUI programming, Java Server Pages (JSP), etc., are not covered.

Notes from the student (any of this could be subject to change):
+All the professors lecture the same curriculum and give the same coursework, which Autolab grades. The instructions for each assignment are available on the CS111 website. 

#Important to note: 
+The assignments are visible on Canvas but provide no useful insight.
+All communications are via Piazza.
+Expect the assignments to be posted with missing or incomplete files and fixed later (check Piazza for updates).
+Download the assignment zip files from AutoLab.
+AutoLab has an AI and plagarism detector.
+Your TA can assist with the concepts taught.
+It is forbidden to seek or receive assistance with programming assignments from the TAs or AI.
+There are two midterms and one final (see exams folder).
+Each week, a recitation block takes attendance (lectures don't).
+Every Sunday, there is a 2-3 question "quiz" (free points, very easy).
+Assignments are due at **11 pm**
