Your grade is computed out of 1000 points. The donut chart to the right has the distribution of the 1000 points among assignments, recitation attendance, quizzes and exams.

Each recitation is 5 points (3 attendance, 1 pre quiz, 1 post quiz). You have to attend at least 10 recitations and take the respective quizzes for the full 50 points. 

Quiz points are dependent upon recitation attendance (if you donâ€™t attend a recitation it is 0 (zero) points even if you take the quizzes). 

Canvas will retain the highest 10 scores (up to 50 points) and drop the remaining lowest scores.

To compute your grade sum up all the assignments, exams, and recitations points (up to 10 recitations).

There is no curve. You must earn a minimum of 900 of the available points for an A, 850 for a B+, 800 for a B, 750 for a C+, 

700 for a C, and 600 for a D. You will fail the course if you earn less than 600 points.

The cutoffs are strictly followed for each letter grade. A computed grade of 749.99 is a C not a C+.

Extra credit Surveys. For the purpose of improving the course, there are two surveys that you will be asked to fill out, 

an entry survey at the beginning of the semester and an exit survey at the end of the semester. 

The surveys are extra credit and each is worth 2.5 points.

The surveys will be sent in a Canvas announcement.
